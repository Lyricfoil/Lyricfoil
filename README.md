- Wow, a LOT has changed in my life in just a couple years. Even more in just the last few months. But, the blunt of it is, I've finally gotten myself into college! I started up studying IT with a focus on Cyber Security. It's been hard...really freaking hard. However, I'm not giving up! I may fail. Yet that doesn't mean I'll quit with what I'm doing. Thanks for reading stranger. You have no idea how tired, relieved, sad, angry, and scared I am writing right now...Yeah.
